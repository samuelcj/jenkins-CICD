JENKINS PIPELINE JOBS
In this kind of job, we use scripts (jenkinsfile) written in groovy language to configure all the build parts and steps.
The best practice is for the script to be together with our application codes in our source code manager (SCM), eg github.

Using the SCM Pipeline Jobs for Jenkins
-- We need to set up the git repository with credentials
-- Remember to set the right path of the jenkinsfile in the space provided for the script path.

JENKINS FILE SYNTAX FOR PIPELINE
This can eitheir be written as a scriped or declerative pipeline. I will be using the declerative pipeline format.

** pipeline: must be at the top level
** agent: where to execute the build. Most times it is "agent any"
** stages: where you have all your stages that contains the "steps" that execute the scripts you ant to run on the jenkins server.
** post: Optionally used to execute a logic after all the stages are done. It comes with some condition utilities like:
    always: a logic that runs eitheir all the stages are successful or not. eg sending mails for each build status
    success: if the build is successful
    failure: if the build fails
*** when expressions: These are conditions that are found inside of stages to determine when that stage runs.
** environment: for setting environment varriables.
** tools: This provides us with build tools for the project. Jenkins by default supports: maven, gradle and jdk.
** parameters: some external configurations that would be needed in the project. Can be used together with when expression.
script: a functionality inside of steps in stages, that helps reduce complexity by defining the scripts to run in another groovy script. called script.groovy.
** input: Use to take in parameters for a particular stage.
*** withCredentials: used to call the values of the credentials stored in Jenkins.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARRIABLES IN JENKINS FILE
1. Jenkins have some in-built environment varriables and can be found at:
    <jenkins-url>/env-vars.html         => http://172.22.159.46:8080/env-vars.html
2. You can also set your own environment using the encironment utility in the groovy script.

CREDENTIALS IN JENKINSFILE.
They are usually set in the Jenkins GUI, but are called inside the environment block.but called with credentials. eg:
    SERVER_CREDENTIALS = credentials('<credential key>')
NB: You'll need the credentials plugin installed for this to work. Its called the "Credentials Binding"

USING GROOVY SCRIPTS
This is used to reduce the weight and complexity of our jenkins file by having the script session of our stages outside the jenkins file.
This enables easy updating and also flexibility of the jenkins file. This script i usually called script.groovy.

MULTI-BRANCH PIPELINE JOBS
This gives usthe leverage to use one job in managing multiple pipelines with ease and more efficiently.
