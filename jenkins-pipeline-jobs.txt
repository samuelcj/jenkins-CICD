JENKINS PIPELINE JOBS
In this kind of job, we use scripts (jenkinsfile) written in groovy language to configure all the build parts and steps.
The best practice is for the script to be together with our application codes in our source code manager (SCM), eg github.

Using the SCM Pipeline Jobs for Jenkins
-- We need to set up the git repository with credentials
-- Remember to set the right path of the jenkinsfile in the space provided for the script path.

JENKINS FILE SYNTAX FOR PIPELINE
This can eitheir be written as a scriped or declerative pipeline. I will be using the declerative pipeline format.

** pipeline: must be at the top level
** agent: where to execute the build. Most times it is "agent any"
** stages: where you have all your stages that contains the "steps" that execute the scripts you ant to run on the jenkins server.
