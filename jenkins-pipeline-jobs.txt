JENKINS PIPELINE JOBS
In this kind of job, we use scripts (jenkinsfile) written in groovy language to configure all the build parts and steps.
The best practice is for the script to be together with our application codes in our source code manager (SCM), eg github.

1. Using the SCM Pipeline Jobs for Jenkins
-- We need to set up the git repository with credentials
-- Remember to set the right path of the jenkinsfile in the space provided for the script path.
